# Supply Chain Inventory Simulation

This Python project simulates inventory dynamics in a supply chain environment to optimize inventory levels and evaluate performance against demand variability.

## Features

- **Inventory Types:** Calculates cycle stock, safety stock, and in-transit stock to manage inventory effectively.
- **Simulation:** Tracks inventory on-hand and in-transit over time to simulate real-world supply chain scenarios.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Evaluates stockouts and service levels to assess the effectiveness of inventory policies.
- **Modularity:** Code is modular, making it easy to adjust parameters and extend functionalities.

## Requirements

- Programming Language: `Python 3.x`
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/supply-chain-inventory-simulation.git
   cd supply-chain-inventory-simulation
   ```
   
2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required libraries and dependencies.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the simulation:**

   ```bash
   python inventory simulation.py
   ```

4. **View simulation results:**
   The simulation results will be displayed in the console and stored in a DataFrame (`simulation_results.csv`).
